# Obesity Prediction Model üè•

A machine learning project that predicts obesity categories using lifestyle and physical condition data. The model classifies individuals into different obesity levels based on various behavioral and demographic features.

## üìä Overview

This project implements a machine learning model to predict obesity levels based on eating habits, physical condition, and lifestyle choices. It uses a comprehensive dataset with both categorical and numerical features to make accurate predictions across seven different obesity categories.

## ‚ú® Features

- Multi-class obesity prediction
- Comprehensive data preprocessing
- Feature importance analysis
- Model performance evaluation
- Cross-validation implementation
- Handling of imbalanced classes
- Interactive visualizations

## üîß Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Required libraries:
  ```
  numpy>=1.21.0
